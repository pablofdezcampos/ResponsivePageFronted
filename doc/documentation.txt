#CSS

- What is CSS -> sheet style on cascade. It is on cascade cause of if you have the same selector in a file.css, that file is going to choose the last code.

- CSS call:
        - <style> h1 {} </style>

                                            - html {font-size: 62.5%;}
                                            - body {font-size: 16px;}
                                            - Easier way to code with rem, cause of 1rem = 10px
